# Decisions Log

ADR-style record of decisions and why they were made. Append new entries at the top

## D-006 — SysML v2 text (authored in Syside Modeler / VS Code) is the source of truth; Cameo is optional and downstream

**Date:** 2026-09-19
**Status:** active. Amends the tool half of D-003 ("SysML in Cameo"); the language,
method, and everything else in D-003 stand.

**Decision:**

1. The `.sysml` files under `projects/nas-sos-capstone/cameo_models/`, authored in
   Syside Modeler in VS Code, are the single source of truth for the architecture model.
2. Cameo/MagicDraw is **not** the source of truth. Anything brought into Cameo (by
   import, script, or hand rebuild) is a derived copy; if it and the `.sysml` text
   disagree, the text wins and the Cameo copy is regenerated or fixed.
3. Getting the model into Cameo is deferred and optional — see the hand-off options in
   `workflows/update-architecture.md`.
4. `prework/nas_system_of_systems_architecture.xml` is a pre-modeling draft. It was
   described as generated from Cameo, but no Cameo export ever existed; it is not kept in
   sync with the `.sysml` files. If it disagrees with them, the `.sysml` files win.

**Rationale:** The university's Cameo/MagicDraw install (2024x Refresh 1, checked
2026-09-19) does not support SysML v2 out of the box, and no known tool converts v2 text
into a form it can open. The model was already being authored in SysML v2 text, so making
Cameo the source of truth would have meant rebuilding it by hand in SysML v1 just to
satisfy the workflow doc. Keeping the text as the source avoids a two-model sync problem
until a reliable import path exists.

**Alternatives considered:** Cameo (SysML v1) as the source of truth with the `.sysml`
text as a scratch draft (rejected — duplicates the model in a different metamodel, and
the v1 copy would drift); requesting a newer Cameo release that supports v2 (the university may be able to
provide one, but the user chose not to pursue it; if it were obtained, direct textual
import would become the hand-off path and this decision's source-of-truth call would be
unchanged).

**Adviser:** Mark Petrotta recommended Syside/SysML v2 and will accept it as the model
deliverable (per the user, 2026-09-19).

**Open consequences:** The `cameo_models/` folder name is now historical (it holds the
SysML v2 model); renaming it would touch many references and hasn't been done.

**Evidence / source:** 2026-09-19 session — user's report of Cameo 2024x Refresh 1
lacking SysML v2 support, and the direction that Syside/VS Code is the source of truth.

## D-005 — Instance/scenario content and simulation code kept separate from the structural model, with a documented (not language-level) trace between SysML and Python

**Date:** 2026-09-19
**Status:** active

**Decision:** Three file-organization/pattern choices for extending the SysML v2 model
going forward:

1. Structural definitions (domains, system types — D-002's decomposition) stay in
   `cameo_models/tutorial.sysml`; concrete scenario instances (a specific flight, its
   airports/procedures) go in new files under `cameo_models/scenarios/`, one per
   scenario.
2. The vehicle-dynamics simulation capability is split: SysML declares only the
   interface (a `calc def` in the `DecisionSupport` package — reflecting the project's
   existing "decision-support is a capability, not a physical system" framing), and the
   real physics is a plain Python module under
   `projects/nas-sos-capstone/simulation/` (a sibling of `cameo_models/`, not inside it,
   since it's code/deliverable content for §12, not model content for §10).
3. The link between the `calc def` and the Python implementation is a documented,
   hand-maintained trace (doc comments naming the module/function, and field names kept
   identical on both sides) — not a language-level binding.

**Rationale:** SysML v2 does support an opaque external-language `calc def` body
(`language "..." /* code */`), but the only broadly-implemented execution path for that
runs through Jython (JVM Python 2), tool-specific to commercial modelers like
NoMagic/Cameo — not CPython, and not a fit for real physics (numpy/scipy) or for a tool
this project can't confirm supports it. Keeping the model and the code as separate
artifacts with an explicit, human-readable trace is the same shape the project already
uses for decision-support/optimization generally (README.md/index.md working
assumptions: a capability layered on the architecture, not embedded in it) — extending
that pattern to simulation keeps the project's tooling assumptions consistent instead of
introducing a second, incompatible integration style.

**Alternatives considered:** Embedding Python via `calc def`'s `language` opaque body
(rejected — Jython-only in practice, not verified against this project's tool, wrong
Python semantics for numeric work); a `part def` for the vehicle dynamics model under
`AircraftSystems` instead of `DecisionSupport` (rejected — it's a simulation/analysis
capability that reads and predicts Aircraft state, not a constituent onboard system,
same reasoning the project already applies to decision-support/optimization).

**Evidence / source:** `workflows/sysml-instance-modeling.md`,
`workflows/vehicle-simulation-model.md`, and 2026-09-19 web research on SysML v2 calc-def
external-language support (Jython-based in current tools) — see
`projects/nas-sos-capstone/journal/2026-09-19.md` for the session's search trail.

## D-002 — Layered domain decomposition over a flat object list

**Date:** captured retroactively, 2026-08-29 (decision predates this log)
**Status:** active, but explicitly provisional — see [[open-questions]]

**Decision:** Organize the architecture around connected domains (Governance, Airspace
Management, Airspace Resources, Flight Operations, Airport Operations, Aircraft Systems,
Information Services, Infrastructure, Decision Support) built around authority,
responsibility, and information ownership — rather than a flat catalog of aviation
objects (aircraft, radars, airports, etc.).

**Rationale:** A flat list of "things in aviation" doesn't expose who owns what
responsibility or how information moves between owners, which are the questions an ISD
architecture needs to answer. The domain decomposition makes airspace sectors, controller
responsibilities, flight intent, clearances, weather products, surveillance tracks, and
trajectory intent into first-class architecture elements instead of background noise.

**Alternatives considered:** Physical/object-based decomposition (rejected — hides
authority/information ownership); a single all-encompassing NAS diagram (rejected — not
bounded enough to finish).

**Revisit when:** `projects/nas-sos-capstone/to-do-list.md` §6 ("Explore Alternative
System Decompositions") is worked — that section explicitly plans to build organization-based,
lifecycle-based, physical, information-flow, and decision-authority decompositions and
compare them. This decision may be confirmed, refined, or replaced by a decision to keep
multiple parallel viewpoints instead of one canonical decomposition.

## D-001 — Pivot from trajectory/rendezvous optimization to NAS-as-SoS architecture

**Date:** captured retroactively, 2026-08-29 (decision predates this log)
**Status:** active

**Decision:** Reframe the capstone from a rendezvous/trajectory optimization problem to
a broader systems-of-systems architecture of the National Airspace System, with
optimization/decision-support demoted to one capability inside that architecture rather
than the whole subject.

**Rationale:** The original optimization framing didn't showcase the strengths an ISD
capstone is meant to demonstrate — architecture, interfaces, responsibility,
traceability. The NAS-as-SoS framing does, while still leaving room for an optimization
case study (see `projects/nas-sos-capstone/to-do-list.md` §11–§13) to demonstrate how
architecture exposes cross-stakeholder impacts that a standalone optimizer would miss.

**Alternatives considered:** Keep the narrow trajectory-optimization scope (rejected —
too mathematical, not architecture-centric enough); go fully broad and survey all of
aviation (rejected — not bounded enough to finish, see index.md working
assumptions).

**Evidence:** `projects/nas-sos-capstone/prework/gpt_convos.md` (both conversations),
`README.md` "Capstone Direction" and "Working Assumptions" sections.
